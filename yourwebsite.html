		The first step to building a free website is choosing a website builder platform. Where once one required a long list of credentials to make a beautiful website, these days, you need neither HTML nor CSS coding skills to get a website up and running. With the right website builder, you should be able to complete your own website in no time.

	<h2>Choose a Platform</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<a href="https://www.wix.com/" target="blank">Wix</a>
		</li>
		<li> 
			<a href="https://wordpress.com/?aff=27964" target="blank">word press</a>
		
	</li>
		
	</ul>

	<p>Once you choose a website builder you can begin setting up your site. The best creator software will instruct you step-by-step about how to create your site, but most begin by having you input the purpose of your site.</p>
